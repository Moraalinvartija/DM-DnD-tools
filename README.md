<h2>Item Price Logic</h2>
<p>-These item prices are more like guidelines from my point of view. Dont use them if you think they are garbage or dont fit your own campaing world</p>
<p>-Legendary items are priced very high (maybe so high that players cant even buy them), reason for that is --> I think legendary items are so rare that they shouldnÂ´t be bought. Players get them from quests or questlines. But we need to give them some kind of price range in case players want to sell them.</p>
